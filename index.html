        <p>Hello and welcome to WASM vulnerabilities</p>

        <p>This repository contains 3 different vulnerabilities (although all of them arguably have some form of XSS). 
            Nevertheless, the 3 vulnerabilities are as follows:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong><a href="/dom-based-xss/async/">Simple DOM-based XSS: </a></strong> This is a simple DOM-based XSS vulnerability with a data flow from
                    JavaScript to WASM and back. This is as a baseline example for data flow analysis of WASM. Click on either of
                    the links below to see it in action:
                    <br>
                    *Note: The only difference between sync and async is an emscripten compilation flag and how the scripts are loaded.
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="/dom-based-xss/sync/">Sync version</a> *does NOT work on Chrome.</li>
                        <li><a href="/dom-based-xss/async/">Async version</a></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong><a href="/buffer-overflow/">Buffer Overflow: </a></strong> This is a C buffer overflow example caused by mismatched buffer sizes between
                    JavsScript and C code and some really poor programming overall. Click <a href="/buffer-overflow/">here</a>
                    to see the buffer overflow in action.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong><a href="/arbitrary-code-execution/">Arbitrary Code Injection: </a></strong> This is an example of using the unsafe Javascript API (eval) in WASM
                    to invoke alert. This lets the user inject and execute arbitrary code. Click <a href="/arbitrary-code-execution/">here</a>
                    to see the ACE in action.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
